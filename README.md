## What I learned.

This is one of the Capstone Projects in Bob Ziroll's Learn React Course on Scrimba and I had to make use of what I had learned on useState and useEffect in order to solidify my learning. I also learned about Lazy State initialization in react and I implemented this while getting the the 'best score' feature from localStorage.
